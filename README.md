This Drupal module allows easy access to modify parts of the CMS to further
enhance the experience for customers. Out of the box it reroutes the default
url for the contact form, sets up a file for custom twig functions, and adds
the ability to adjust how the inline_entity_form module works for users,
changing the default UI from an autocomplete field, to a dropdown for easily
finding the correct referenced item.
